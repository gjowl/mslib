Below is the order of things you did for a design run:
    - extract geometries from a set of structures:
        - determine the spaces that are most common as starting points by density
    - plot those geometries and develop a geometric space by:
        - checking for the interface for different geometries using SASA (?)
        - generating random geometries from a set of given limits 
    - design sequences:
        - input a random geometry
        - use a monte carlo to both search through sequences and geometric space
    - analyze design data:
        - determine sequences that are good candidates for an additional, longer local backbone optimization
        - run backbone optimization script on the input pdb
    - input backbone optimized data into experimental comparison:

I have nice scripts to help with analysis of the design data WITH experimental data. I have some very shitty scripts 
to help analyze just the design data alone...
