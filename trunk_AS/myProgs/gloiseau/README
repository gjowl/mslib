Scripts
seqDesign:
    - my sequence design code
    - designs homodimer sequences only up to the number that you desire for a given sequence (I defaulted to 5)
    - uses calculated homodimer baseline energies to estimate the monomer sequence
    - calculates the sequence entropy of the interface 
        - compares using an input file of given entropy values for each sequence/how frequently
        an amino acid is found in a membrane protein
        - I calculated it from the membrane proteins I extracted geometries from in 2019, and was
        inspired to do it by Liu et al. Genome Biology 2002
    - does local backbone optimization after each designed sequence, changing the geometry a bit for
    each sequence design monte carlo run
interhelicalCoordinates:
    - code that Alessandro wrote to identify interactions from membrane protein PDBs
    - used to generate the membrane protein geometry landscape we used for protein design
    - needs GSL to build
generateSelfPairIMM1Baselines:
    - generates the baseline energies that were used as estimates for monomer sequences
BaselinePairInteractions:
    - object used for calculating the baseline interactions used as estimates for monomer
    sequences in sequence design code
getPolyAlaSasa:
    - generates SASA values for a polyalanine based sequence
CATM_v24.5:
    - updated version of CATM with the following changes:
        - added option to allow for electrostatic energies to be calculated
        - added option for turning off energy calculation at the helix ends
        - added option to only save negative energy structures
bbOptimizer:
    - code that can either take in a pdb or set a homodimer sequence to a given geometry and does a 
    local backbone optimization to get the most stable energy for the sequence
    - Can input a sequence that is different from the given pdb and it should replace the sequence
    - I use this code after sequence design to locally optimize the geometry (also done during the
    design process, but this does a longer locally optimized repack)
    - To ensure a local backbone optimization, it decreases the potential geometric shifts 
    (ie. if xShift starts allowing 0.5 changes, after the first time it makes that change, it decreases
     the potential next xShift towards a minimum using a monte carlo step decrease)
geomRepack_11_09_2021:
    - early version of backbone optimizer code
findPdbSasaVoids:
    - if given an input pdb, can identify voids. a practice version of getting voids in input PDBs
