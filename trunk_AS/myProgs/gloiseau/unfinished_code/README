This directory contains code that I didn't end up finishing.
Parts of it could be useful for future work (likely just the functions),
so feel free to look through it if you're interested.

bbOptimizer_tests:
    - contains older versions of code for my backbone optimization script
forwardFolding_tests: 
    - efforts to make a piece of code similar to CATM but for other proteins
    outside of GASright region. Didn't work out too well and took a long time
    to run
rosettaScripts_tests:
    - contains helper code for running rosetta when I was trying to use rosetta
    to predict my structures
seqDesign_tests:
    - contains code for sequence design scripts that I didn't end up finishing.
    I think the functions could be useful for future work and there may be some 
    TODO ideas in the heterodimer script
