# This is a penalty file based on the sample_composition.comp files for the AACompositionEnergy.cc energy scoring function from Rosetta
# The penalty file is a file that holds the types of amino acids, preferences for each in the designed sequence output, and any penalties for not following these preferences
#
# TODO: Copy the intro to the sample_composition.comp file in here to make it make more sense to average reader
# TODO: Think of a way to choose Penalties for each individual AA. For example, might be nice if the penalty for ALA is much less than penalty for MET
