If using from a windows computer:
Install WSL (windows subsystem for linux)

When initializing on a computer for the first time:
    sudo apt install make
    sudo apt install g++-10

Change the .cshrc file to accomodate file paths on your computer for the MSL environment variables.

When running the first time, make sure to look that the -I during the make is /your/path/to/environment/variables and not /usr/lib.

If it is /usr/lib, then it is likely not reading your .cshrc file. Make sure that tcsh is downloaded on your computer by running:
    sudo apt install tcsh
    
Then on the command line, run csh to set your terminal to a csh terminal (in some cases it defaults to bash). Run:
    source /path/to/.cshrc

To make the objects and the binary files, first run the following in mslib/trunk_AS to make the directories needed:
    mkdir bin
    mkdir objs

Finally, run:
    make

This should make all of the objs and start making the binary files as well.
