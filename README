If using from a windows computer:
Install WSL (windows subsystem for linux)

When initializing on a computer for the first time:
    sudo apt install make
    sudo apt install g++-10

Change the .cshrc file to accomodate file paths on your computer for the MSL environment variables.

Make sure that tcsh is downloaded on your computer by running:
    sudo apt install tcsh

Then on the command line, run csh to set your terminal to a csh terminal (in some cases it defaults to bash) by running:
    exec tcsh

To set the environment variables to the defaults you need for msl, run:
    source /path/to/.cshrc

To make the objects and the binary files, first run the following in mslib/trunk_AS to make the directories needed:
    mkdir bin
    mkdir objs

Finally, run:
    make

This should make all of the objs and start making the binary files as well.


Other errors:
-   If you run source /path/to/.cshrc and it errors: 
        set: Variable name must contain alphanumeric characters.
    Then you need to change the .cshrc file to have the correct line endings for unix. To do this, run:
        sudo apt install dos2unix
    Reset the terminal or open a new terminal and run:
        dos2unix /path/to/.cshrc
-   When running the first time, make sure to look that the -I during the make is /your/path/to/environment/variables and not /usr/lib.
    If it is /usr/lib, then it is likely not reading your .cshrc file. To fix this, run:
        source /path/to/.cshrc
        make clean
        make
-   If the make fails at the BBQTable and everything else seems correct, you may be running with the improper version of g++.
